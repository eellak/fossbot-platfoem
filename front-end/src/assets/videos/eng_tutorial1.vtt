Welcome to the FOSSBot platform!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're going to learn how to control our FOSSBot in the simulator.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's going to be fun and easy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's get started!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First of all

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's talk about some basic commands to make our robot move.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Remember

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can pause the video anytime and try the commands yourself.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
To start we have the just move command

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This command lets our robot move in the direction

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we tell it to until we stop it

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We can choose to move it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
forward or backward

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Next, we have the move step command

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This one is cool because it moves our robot one step at a time

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Just tell it to go forward or backward

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And it will take a single step in that direction

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we want our robot to move a bit more

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can use the move forward distance command

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This makes our robot move forward by a specific distance we choose

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Just tell it how far to go

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
From moving backward we have the move reverse distance command

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It works just like the forward command

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But our robot will go backward instead

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Just tell it the distance

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And off it goes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
To stop our robot we use the stop command

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Just say stop

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And the robot will stop moving simple right

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's learn how to turn our robot

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The rotate 90 command will make a robot turn 90°

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We can make it turn left

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Left or right

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If we want a smaller turn

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We use the rotate 45

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Five Command

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This will turn our robot 45° to the left or right

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For even more control we have the rotate degrees command

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This lets us choose any angle for our robot to turn

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Just tell it the number of degrees and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it will turn that much

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
To make tiny adjustments we can use rotate clockwise and rotate counterclockwise commands

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Each of these will turn our robot just degree

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Clockwise means to the right and counterclockwise means to the left

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Lastly we have the just rotate command

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This one lets our robot keep turning in the direction we choose either left or right

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And remember when we use the move forward step

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Move backward step

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
rotate 90, rotate45

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
commands the robot will wait until it's done moving before it does anything else

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.000
That's it for now

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Try out these commands and see how your fault moves

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Have fun exploring and learning
